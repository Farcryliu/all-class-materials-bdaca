Teaching materials for BDACA and related courses, after overhaul

The courses "Big Data and Automated Content Analysis" (6 EC) and "Big Data and Automated Content Analysis Part I and II" (12 EC) have been taught for many years now, and we keep the teaching materials available (e.g., [here](https://github.com/annekroon/bdaca-6ec) and [here](https://github.com/damian0604/bdaca)). While we  (Anne Kroon and Damian Trilling) have continously updated them, with our move to a [new book](https://cssbook.net/), *Computational Analysis of Communication: A practical introduction to the analysis of texts, networks, and images with code examples in Python and R* by Wouter van Atteveldt, Damian Trilling, and Carlos Arcila Calderon, it's time for a major overhaul to get rid of some old burdens: code that is not best practice any more, outdated examples, etc.

During the upcoming edition of the courses in 2021, we will gradually add the new materials here.
