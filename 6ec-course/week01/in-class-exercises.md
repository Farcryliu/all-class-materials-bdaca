# Exercises Lab Session Week 1

## 1. Explore Jupyter Notebook

-   Write a very simple program (e.g., using simple assignments (`a = 5`), arithmetic operations (`a + b`), and the `print()` function) and run it.
  - Add Markdown cells with some explanations. You can find a comprehensive guide to Markdown at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax
  
-   Explore how to interact with Jupyter Notebook and discuss with your neighbor.

## 2. Run a simple program in multiple ways
- Check out different ways of running Python code. Can you use the `python` interpreter on the command line?
  
- You can also consider working with a text editor, or an IDE like `spyder` or `VS Code`. It's not about which tool you use exactly, but to explore different possibilities.

## 3. Run (and modify!) the code in the example Jupyter Notebook

- Please download the notebook from Canvas >Modules>Week1
- If you use the examples from the book (Chapter 2) **skip** the examples using `geopandas`.
  
- But make sure to (1) install the necessary packages, and (2) import them.
  
- Try to guess the working of elements of the code by playing around with it and changing parts!
