# Exercises week 7

Using the data and code you worked on last week as a starting point (IMDB, Vermeer, or own data), **find the best classifier using techniques such as pipelines, cross validation, and hyperparameter-tuning.** Don't forget to set aside a separate test set for final evaluation!


From now on, it's also a good idea to work on *own datasets* that you have or find interesting!
