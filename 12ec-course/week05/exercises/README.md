# ML with scikit-learn

The purpose of today's exercise is to get your feet wet using `scikit-learn` for machine learning. There is an example dataset available, `airbnb-datafile.csv`, but you are more than welcome to use own data instead.

For this week, we will only focus on numerical features; you can disregard the textual columns if you want to. In the second part of the course, we will learn how you can also transfer the textual columns into features that can be used as input for machine learning.


## 0. Explore the data

As always, before you start, explore the data. If you want to, you can clean up a bit; but this may not be necessary. 

## 1. Unsupervised ML

Use an unsupervised approach to group the appartments based on some features you select. After you have done that, give a descriptive overview of how the different groups of appartments differ and interpret these differences.

## 2. Supervised ML

Try to predict the overall rating based on the other features. You can choose to transform the rating into two (or more) categories to treat this as a classification rather than a regression problem. Compare multiple models and select the best one.
